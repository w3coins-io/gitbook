# Fetch.ai

**Fetch.ai** provides an open infrastructure that enables individuals and businesses to build smart, offline services. Using Fetch.ai technology, users can deploy agents: pieces of code that can create intelligent connections between different systems and devices. This technology allows users to explore new possibilities, from simple AI-driven coordination tasks to complex business logic, and it serves as a platform for discovery and innovation. Fetch.ai creates a parallel digital reflection of the world where autonomous agents can interact with each other to perform useful tasks that businesses can use to optimize their operations, provide offers or discounts to individuals, or analyze sensor data from remote businesses. All of this can happen without human intervention.
